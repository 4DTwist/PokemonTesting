This is a practice project.

The goals of this practice project are;
1. To practically use Inheritance, Interfaces 
2. To work on Unit Testing, and TTD
3. To brush up on the finer points of enumeration

The reason I have chosen Pokemon as a base for what to make is because it's a system I understand well without referring to a document, and has many features to implement that are ideal for brushing up on Inheritance and Interfacing, such as elemental types that can be applied through Inheritance, or ensuring different Pokemon adhere to a common interface.

Roughly speaking here...
- An interface is used here as a proof of concept, ensuring the base Pokemon class implements a few methods.
- That is then inherited from for a few types, which then add strengths and weaknesses to their base class, and allow for different attack methods.
- Finally a class with the Pokemons name inherits that type. That is then tested.
