This is a practice project.

The goals of this practice project are;
1. To practically use Inheritance, Interfaces 
2. To work on Unit Testing, and TTD
3. To brush up on the finer points of enumeration
4. To create a text-based "clone" of the pokemon system, adding features logically

The reason I have chosen Pokemon as a base for what to make is because it's a system I understand well without referring to a document, and has many features to implement that are ideal for brushing up on Inheritance and Interfacing, such as elemental types that can be applied through Inheritance, or ensuring different Pokemon adhere to a common interface.
